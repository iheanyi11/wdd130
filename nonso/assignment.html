      <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where systems learn from data without explicit programming.</li>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> AI refers to machines designed to simulate human intelligence, including learning and problem-solving.</li>
      <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> A machine learning model trained on labeled data to predict outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> A machine learning model that finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.</li>

    <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
    <h4>Create a problem that can be solved by identifying the issues,  
      debugging and isolating or solving the problem. 
      You are to document the procedure on how you go about it. 
      Got instant how puzzles works,
      it is a problem on its own and needs solving to achieve it aims and goals. </h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Problem:</strong>A local restaurant recently launched a website with a contact form where customers can send inquiries. However, the restaurant owner reports that they are not receiving any emails from the form.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Solution:</h5>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the Issue
      The expected behavior: When a user submits the form, an email should be sent to the restaurant‚Äôs email address.
      The actual behavior: Users see a success message, but the restaurant never receives the email.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Debugging and Isolating the Problem
      Check the Frontend (HTML & JavaScript)
      Verify the form structure in contact.html:
      Ensure that the form has the correct action and method attributes.
      Check JavaScript for form submission errors
      Open the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) and test submitting the form.
      If there are JavaScript errors, they would show here.
      In this case, there are no JavaScript errors.
      Check the Backend (Server & Email Logic)
      Verify the route handling the form submission
      Check the email sending function 
      The email service might be blocked due to incorrect credentials.
      Environment variables (EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS) may not be set correctly.
      Check the Server Logs for Errors
      Run the server in debug mode. The error confirms that the email credentials are incorrect.
      Check Environment Variables
      View the .env file. Issue found: The email credentials are incorrect.

      Update the credentials in .env. Fixed the credentials.

      Retest the Contact Form
      Restart the server:
      Submit a test form on the website.
      Success! The restaurant now receives emails from the contact form.</p>
    <p><strong>Final Documentation Summary</strong></p>
      <p>‚úÖ<strong>Problem:</strong> Contact form emails were not being sent.</p>
      <strong><p>‚úÖ Process:</p></strong>
      
      <p>1. Checked the frontend form structure (‚úÖ No issues).</p>
      <p>2. Checked the JavaScript console (‚úÖ No errors).</p>
      <p>3. Debugged the backend email-sending logic (üîç Found incorrect credentials).</p>
      <p>4. Updated email service credentials (‚úÖ Fixed issue).</p>
      <p>5. Retested the form (üéâ Emails are now being received).</p>

      <br>

      <strong><p>Conclusion:</p></strong>
        <p>This problem was solved by systematic debugging‚Äîidentifying the issue, 
          isolating the problem area, and methodically testing and fixing the cause. 
          This process applies to any kind of website bug, 
          making it a crucial problem-solving technique in web development! üöÄ</p>
